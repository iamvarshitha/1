Arithmetic Problem Generator
This Python script generates arithmetic problems consisting of randomly generated operands and operators. It prompts the user to solve these problems and provides feedback on their answers.
Customization
You can customize the range of operands and the operators used in the arithmetic problems by modifying the variables at the beginning of the script:

min_operand: The minimum value for operands.
max_operand: The maximum value for operands.
operators: The list of operators to choose from.
Feel free to adjust these variables to generate problems of varying difficulty.
